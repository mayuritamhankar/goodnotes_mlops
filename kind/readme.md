# kind/cluster-config.yaml
This YAML file is a configuration for creating a local Kubernetes cluster using KinD (Kubernetes in Docker). It defines a cluster with two nodes: one control-plane node and one worker node. The control-plane node is responsible for managing the cluster and running core Kubernetes components, while the worker node is where application workloads will run.

For the control-plane node, extraPortMappings are specified to map ports 80 and 443 from the container to the host machine. This allows you to access services running on these standard HTTP and HTTPS ports from your local machine, which is especially useful for testing Ingress controllers or web applications.

Both nodes use the kindest/node:v1.29.2 image, which matches a specific Kubernetes version. The networking section specifies that the default CNI (Container Network Interface) should not be disabled (disableDefaultCNI: false), ensuring that basic networking is set up automatically. The kubeProxyMode is set to iptables, which is the default mode for managing network rules in Kubernetes clusters.

At the bottom, the apiVersion and kind fields declare this as a KinD cluster configuration. There are also commented-out kubeadmConfigPatches, which could be used to further customize the Kubernetes control plane if needed, but they are not active in this configuration. This setup is suitable for local development and testing of multi-node Kubernetes environments.
